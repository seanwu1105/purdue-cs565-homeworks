Proof.

  (* This goal is just a specialization of the fact we proved above.
     The apply tactic allows us to /instantiate/ universally
     quantified variables in a theorem with specific values to build a

Theorem plus_6_6_injective : forall m : nat,

(* In other words, once we have proven (or assumed) a fact starting

(* More interesting is that we can also specialize this theorem by

(* Let's peel back the curtain a bit to see how apply works more generally: *)

(* This fact is reflected in the elimination rule for the universal quantifier:
   Gamma |- forall (v : nat), P v    Gamma |- n : nat
   ======================================
   Gamma |- P n

  In other words, if I have evidence of the claim that [P v] holds for any number [v],
  and I have a specific number [n], I can establish evidence that [P n] holds.

(** [apply] can be used with a lemma or assumption with *any* number

(** We can use [apply] when some hypothesis or an earlier lemma
    exactly matches the goal (i.e. it has no variables to specialize): *)

Proof.

    the goal. *)

  symmetry.

             simplification first, if needed. This is similar to how

             sides of an equality before checking whether they are
             same expression. *)

(* AN ASIDE: Equality is an equivalence relation, i.e. it is

   available to us as well? *)
Theorem trans_example : forall (n m o : nat),

   is even. *)

(* Working with universally quantified goals using the [intro] tactic *)

(* Up to now, we've glossed over what is happening when we use
   [intros] to move universally quantified variables from the goal to
   the set of assumptions.

  Formally, the introduction rule for âˆ€ looks like:  *)

  (* Gamma, (m : nat) |- P m
  =============================
  Gamma |- forall (n : nat), P n *)

(* Recall that we read "Gamma |- P" as "Assuming the facts in gamma,
   we can conclude P."  So we can read this rule as (ignoring Gamma) :
   In order to prove that [P n] holds for every number [n], it
   suffices to show that [P m] holds assuming some arbitrary, unknown
   number [m]. Note that implicit in this statement is that even
   though [m] is arbitrary, it is some *specific*, *concrete*
   number. We can then use case analysis (or induction to examine how
   this specific [m] was built. *)

(* Let us use this insight to reexamine what happens when our
   inductive hypothesis is insufficiently generalized.*)

Theorem double_injective_FAILED : forall n m,

(** At this point, the induction hypothesis ([IHn']) does _not_ give us
    [n' = m'] -- there is an extra [S] in the way -- so the goal is
    not provable. *)

Abort.
(** What went wrong? *)

(** Trying to carry out this proof by induction on [n] when [m] is
    already in the context doesn't work because we are then trying to
    prove a statement involving _every_ [n] but just a _single_ [m]. *)

    statement at the point where the [induction] tactic is invoked on

(** * Using Tactics on Hypotheses *)


(* Inference rules can be read in two ways. Recall the rule for
   elimination rule for implication (Modus Ponens): *)

(*   |- A -> B    |- A
     ==================
     |- B *)

(* Reading backwards, from the goal up, this says: "We're trying to
    prove [B], so if we can prove [A -> B], and [A] we'll be done."

    Alternatively, we could read this forwards, from the assumptions
    to the goal: "We know [A] and we know [A -> B], so we also know
    [B]."

   The first interpretation is an example of goal directed "backwards
   reasoning", while the second interpretation is an example of
   "forward reasoning" from the set of known facts / assumptions.

   The [apply] is a tactic for backwards reasoning. In contrast, the
   variant [apply... in...] is forward reasoning: *)
